Web Based Translation / Translator Management Application
---------------------------------------------------------

Features that we must have --

* Web based translation
	-- Multi team
	-- Multi language
	-- Multi products
    
* Support for all types of keymaps

isnt this browser based? as long as the keymaps produce the standard unicode strings, this is irrelevant

* Way to incorporate daily updates in the POT straight from upstream
  CVS/SVN
  
svn+trac
  
* There should be a way to download tarballs of all PO files

please dump the contents of your original mail proposing the project here, and we can work on it
