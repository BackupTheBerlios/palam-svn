After an IRC meet on Tue Oct 25, 2005 we reached a genral consensus on
the following features --

* Whether we will write an application or provide a service to the
  people -- To be decided later

* Statistics -- Must have  

* Online Review -- Must have

* Consistency Checking -- Must have

* Version Control -- A basic form of VC should be there, nothing too
  ambitious, but there will be a way to mark a PO file to be a part of x
  version of y app while uploading. The app will in any case treat PO
  files of different version as separate files. So in a way, the VC will
  be at a higher level than the app itself

* User Profiles -- Unnecessary

* Management Console -- Not needed as volunteers will be able to take up
  work via the stats page itself

* Downloads -- A way to filter translations according to language,
  product, etc. and download tarballs

* Minor Points
  -- Translated UI
  -- Extensive Online Documentation
  -- Email Interface
  -- Screenshot Gallery (?)

* TODO -- Think of more features to put in  

It was also decided that we will try to hack on the Entrans JavaScript
code to do the keymaps and integrate with our app. We'll acknowledge
Entrans as the source of that code.
